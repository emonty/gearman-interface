These are the ruby wrappers for libgearman which can be used to connect
to Gearman.

The C source here is generated from SWIG. That, as well as the larger build
process of which it is a part and from which this source package is derived 
can be checked out from launchpad via:

bzr branch lp:gearman-interface

If you just want to build/install this without doing developement on the C code,
then this source dir is all you need. If you want to develop on the C bindings
themselves, then you'll need the full gearman-interface source tree.

You will need to install echoe from gem:

  gem install echoe

From that point, rake compile should do the trick.
