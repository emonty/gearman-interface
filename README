gearman-interface project.

The project is organized in two parts. The standard process of
./configure ; make will build source files and then run language specific builds
of things in the language subdir.

Do not expect make install to do anything sensible. Install should be run in 
a language specific manner in that language's subdir.

If you pulled from bzr and didn't get a tarball, you'll need to run config/autogen.sh first.
